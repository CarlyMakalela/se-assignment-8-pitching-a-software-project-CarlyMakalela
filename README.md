In a software project pitch, a clear problem statement is crucial because it tells everyone why the software is needed. Imagine you have an app that helps people find nearby restaurants. The problem statement would explain that many people struggle to discover good places to eat when they're in new areas. This makes investors, developers, and users understand why your app is necessary.

To effectively communicate this problem, you should:
1. **Be Specific**: Clearly define the issue your software will address. For example, instead of saying "help people find restaurants," say "help travelers find highly-rated local restaurants quickly."
   
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why this problem is important. For instance, mention how travelers often rely on outdated online reviews or struggle with language barriers when looking for places to eat.

3. **Use Examples**: Share real-life stories or examples. You could talk about a traveler who ended up at a disappointing restaurant because they couldn't find reliable recommendations nearby.

By making your problem statement clear and relatable, you help stakeholders see the value of your software project and why it's worth investing in or developing. This clarity ensures everyone understands the goal and potential impact of your software.

## 3. Solution Description:
